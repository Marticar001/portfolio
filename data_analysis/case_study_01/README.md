#### Objective
My objective is to **analyze 12 months of data** using the skills I learned **to identify the difference between casual riders and annual riders.**

#### Tools Used
- Excel
  - Power Query
- Tableau Public
- R Studio Cloud

### [Preparing the Data]
- I used Excel's **Power Query** to Combine and Edit 12 months of data.
  - Power Query gives me the ability to extract and combine multiple excel files as long as the sheets are all formated similarly
    - I've used this tool in the past to combine more than 700 excel files
  - Using Power QUery also allows me to make large scale edits all without changing original files one by one.
