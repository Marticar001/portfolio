# Case Study 01
## Cyclistic bike-share analysis
### [Introduction]
*This case study was done as part of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?) offered by [COURSERA](https://www.coursera.org/).*

**Data Source:**  https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
- *(The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).)*

#### Objective
My objective is to **analyze 12 months of data** using the skills I learned **to identify the difference between casual riders and annual riders.**

#### Tools Used
- Power BI

### [Preparing and Processing the Data]

1. Made a Copy of all files and converted them from .csv to .xlsx
2. Renamed sheets to "report"
3. Used **Power BI** to Combine and Edit 12 months of data.
    - For more details regarding this process see [HERE](https://github.com/Marticar001/portfolio/tree/main/data_analysis/case_study_01/power_bi)
 
### [Analysis]
I personally like using Power BI because I believe it handles data cleaning better than Tableau.  While Tableau can shine when it comes to complex interactive visuals I believe Power BI can be used when a more simple analysis like this one is needed.

#### Findings
- Casual Riders ride more during the weekend while Members ride more during the weekday
- Casual Riders ride on average 3 times longer than Members
- Only ONE docked bike was used by a Member
- Both types members prefer classic bikes
